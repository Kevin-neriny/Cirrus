A powerful code editor with multi-function error reporting and real AI to help you write code! ! ! (Project under construction)

There are three main features of this editor:
First, AI can help you read all project files (of course, don't worry about project security), and immediately understand what you are doing, the advantage of this is that AI can better help you complete your work, and AI has changed from a question and answer to a real-time job, can check your code in real time, if you find an error, it will directly remind you, and tell you how to improve.

Second: more concise and intuitive error reporting function, I believe that many people think that the content of the compiler's error is a piece of "shit", so our compiler can make the error more readable, by writing all the problem possibilities, and with the real-time work of AI, the code readability is extremely intuitive and easy to understand.
At present, there are 500,000 possibilities for error reporting, and the effective rate is 96.4%. With the correction of the AI, you can get more accurate error reports, and of course, the accuracy rate of the AI will drop to 93.2.

Third: community communication, this project is currently being processed on a large server, the social function is a side dish, mainly to exchange everyone's ideas, of course, this is also a good place to learn programming, which can make your programming ability achieve unprecedented progress.

Another is the opening of freelancing, but the project is incomplete and will not be announced for the time being.
